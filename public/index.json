This is due to the GDPR, which is a regulation for applications serving Europe, so that platforms do not collect user information without making it clear. The fines can be up to 1 million euros, so it is better to think about alternatives.\nI have been researching, and a very good alternative is Bunny Fonts. The interface is very similar to Google Fonts and so is the font import. It just looks like a Google Fonts clone but is GDPR compliant.\nHow do I import a font from bunny fonts? # Simple. Here is a screenshot of the Bunny Fonts home page: Choose the desired font. Click the add variant button for each variant you want to import. This window will open, if not, click Fonts +. And now you only have to copy and paste those styles in your css file, like this:\n@import url(https://fonts.bunny.net/css?family=abeezee:400,400i); body { font-family: \u0026#39;ABeeZee\u0026#39;, sans-serif; } Outro # You have already seen how similar bunny fonts is to google fonts. So remember to use this page instead of google fonts, unless you want to get a big fine!\nThanks for reading this article!\n","date":"22 July 2023","permalink":"/posts/gdpr-compliant-alternative-to-google-fonts/","section":"Posts","summary":"As you probably already know or in case you don\u0026rsquo;t, google fonts is no longer legal in Europe.

If you want to understand what they are, how they work and how we can prevent them as developers, keep reading this article, you will surely learn!\nWhat is a RCE? # A RCE is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to execute malicious code in a remote system, usually on a website.\nThis means that if you have a web application housed on your own server, an attacker could take advantage of a parameter in the URL to inject code. This allows the attacker to get possible access to the server.\nHow does a RCE work? # Imagine that you are hosting a PHP online store on your server and you have a parameter for the functionality of the pagination. Well, an attacker could try a variety of combinations to inject commands.\nThis type of vulnerability is present in many HTB machines so you should master it. The best way? Practice, the more you explode this vulnerability, the easier it will be.\nhttp://www.example.com/index.php?page=;whoami\nIn this case, the attacker is using the Command Injection technique to execute the whoami command to see with which user the app is being executed.\nHow to prevent a RCE? # To prevent a RCE, it is essential to follow good practices. Here are some measures that can be taken to prevent the RCE:\nUpdate the software # Keeping updated software at all times is crucial to ensure that known vulnerabilities are corrected. This includes the operating system, web applications and any service that is executed in the system.\nValidate and sanitize entry # It is important to validate all the user input that is received through the web application to ensure that malicious data is not introduced. This may include the validation of the entrance length, the elimination of special characters and the validation of data types. In addition, entry sanitization refers to the elimination of malicious or dangerous characters from the user input. This may include the elimination of special characters and input coding to avoid code injection.\nConfigure the server safely # Setting the server safe is essential to avoid the RCE. This includes the deactivation of unnecessary services, the use of safe passwords and the implementation of firewall and other security mechanisms.\nAnd although shell can be obtained, it is also important to complicate the privilege escalation as a security measure, so that the attacker gets access, that he cannot do much.\nPerform security tests # Perform regular security tests in the web application and on the server is important to detect any security vulnerability. This may include penetration tests and vulnerabilities analysis, although as a developer you can also try to inject code.\nConclusion # The RCE is a serious threat to the security that can allow an attacker to take complete control of a remote system. To prevent it, it is essential to keep updated software, validate and sanitize the user input, configure the server safely and perform regular safety tests. By following these best security practices, we can significantly reduce the risk of RCE and protect our systems and data against malicious attacks.\nThanks for reading!\nSoon I will write HTB writeups and web development posts!

One of these types of attacks is subdomain takeover, in which an attacker can take control of a subdomain of a website and use it for its own malicious purposes. In this article, we will explore what the subdomain takeover is, how you work and how you can protect your website against it.\nWhat is subdomain takeover? # The vulnerable records are the CNAME, which are the ones that point to another domain.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s give an example. Imagine that you are hosting your project at Github Pages or in some other similar service. You decide that you want a personalized domain, for example: project.example.com that points to user.github.io/project. So far everything is fine.\nBut one day you decide to delete your account, and if someone tries to access your project, he will not be able to do it. Now an attacker can create a Github account with the name you had and use your personalized subdomain to host your own malicious website. If a user tries to access your project, it will be redirected to the attacker\u0026rsquo;s website without even realizing it. This could lead to the phishing, if the page you were staying was a login and the attacker clone that page redirecting the credentials to its database, for example.\nHow the subdomain takeover works # This type of attack is known as subdomain takeover and can have serious consequences for your website and your users. The attacker can use your subdomain to house phishing, malware, or any other malicious content, which can damage your reputation and put the safety of your users at risk.\nIt is important to keep in mind that the example we mention is only one of the scenarios in which a subdomain takeover can occur. There are many other ways in which an attacker can take advantage of a vulnerable subdomain, such as when a third -party service is no longer available and the subdomain is no longer in use.\nTherefore, it is essential that websites owners take measures to protect against this type of attack. Here are some preventive measures that can be taken to avoid a subdomain takeover:\nHow to protect your website against subdomain takeover # Monitor the subdomains: It is important to have a list of all the subdomains used on the website and regularly monitor their status and activity to detect any suspicious change. It is also advisable to monitor inactive subdomains or that are no longer used and deactivated or eliminated if necessary.\nCorrectly configure DNS records: DNS records are a fundamental part of the configuration of a website and must be configured correctly to avoid possible vulnerabilities.\nUse detection tools: There are several tools available online that can help detect possible subdomain takeovers, such as takeover. This tool can scan your domain to see if there are free subdomains.\nConclusions # In conclusion, subdomain takeover is a real risk for any website, and attackers can take advantage of it in various ways. However, there are measures that you can take to detect and prevent this type of attack. It is important to be aware of the threat and take measures to protect your website and your users. Regularly monitor subdomains, correctly configure DNS records and use detection tools are some of the best practices to protect your website against subdomain takeover.\nThanks for your reading!\n","date":"1 May 2023","permalink":"/posts/subdomain-takeover/","section":"Posts","summary":"Computer attacks are increasingly sophisticated and, in many cases, they can go unnoticed for a long time.
